## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured, phased approach to building Sally.ai with clear deliverables at each stage. The plan emphasizes:

1. **Foundation First**: Establishing solid infrastructure before adding complex features
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase produces working, testable functionality
3. **Security by Design**: Encryption and security measures built-in from the start
4. **User Safety**: Prioritizing reliable emergency features above all else
5. **Production Readiness**: Focus on performance, testing, and scalability

The 16-week timeline is aggressive but achievable with a dedicated team. Phases can be parallelized where dependencies allow (e.g., backend development alongside frontend features). Regular testing and user feedback throughout development will ensure the final product meets its mission: **keeping users safe during vulnerable moments**.
